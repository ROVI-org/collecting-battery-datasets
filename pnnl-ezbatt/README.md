# Synthetic Flow Cell Degredation Data

> Note: Logan put _italics_ where he is guessing or has no 

Collects data produced from _finite element_ simulations of flow cell batteries undergoing cycling
with different rates of degredation.

The data was produced using the _EZBatt_ code from Jie at all, described _in this paper_.
The simulations are parameterized to mimick _vanadium flow cells_ produced by _vendor_ 
with a rated capacity of _a large_ W-hr.

The datasets include the current and voltage over time, as well as how the model
parameters vary during each cycle.
